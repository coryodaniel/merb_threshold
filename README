merb_threshold
==============

Merb Threshold provides an easy way to apply control the number of times an action or partial
is accessed by a particular session.  Thresholds can be applied to multiple partials per page and can
even span controllers and actions.

Also all of the methods are pretty well documented, so it might be pretty helpful to look at the method documentation.

=== Usage

==== Modes
	merb_thresholds supports 3 modes:
	
	* wait 
		* a user must wait an allotted amount of time to continue using the resource
		* Merb::GlobalHelper#wait() is included (as a default) to display a partial if the user must wait
		* Generate a default partial with rake merb_threshold:generate_wait OUT=./app/views/shared
		
	* captcha
		* a user is presented with a captcha to continue using the resource
		* uses Recaptcha as the backend
		* Merb::GlobalHelper#captcha() is included (as a default) to display a captcha partial
		* Generate a default partial with rake merb_threshold:generate_captcha OUT=./app/views/shared		
		
	* halt
		* Only works for action based thresholding
		* a user must wait an allotted amount of time to continue using the resource
		* The action can throw halt with anything that a before filter could

==== Action based thresholding
	
	Action based thresholding allows for controlling access to an action as a whole.  The class level 'threshold' method
	is actually just a wrapper around a before filter that calls the instances level threshold.  Providing the
	wrapper does allow for the threshold to halt the filter chain.  
	
	In an action based threshold the threshold_name is always "#{controller_name}/#{action_name}".
	
	Example:
	
	class Users < Application
		threshold :create, :limit => [1, 30.seconds]
		
		# Equivalent to:
		# before(nil,{:only => [:create]}) do
		# 	threshold(default_threshold_name,{:limit => [1,30.seconds]})
		# end
		
		def index
			render
		end
		
		def create
		 #... handle user sign up
		end
	end
	
	# ... in app/views/users/index.html.erb
	# If the form was accessed more than once in 30 seconds, a captcha would be displayed
	<form ...>
		<input .../>
		<%= captcha(:create) %>
	</form>
	
	class SuperSensitiveApi < Application
		# 
		# * this would create a 1 / 30 seconds threshold on all actions in the controller
		# * the halt_with parameter can take anything that throw(:halt) would take
		# * at the class level 'threshold()' is a wrapper around before()
		#
		threshold :limit => [1, 30.seconds], :mode => :halt, :halt_with => "Slow down there pilgrim."
		
		# Equivalent to:
		# before(nil,{}) do
		#		if threshold(default_threshold_name,{:mode => :halt, :limit => [1, 30.seconds]})
    #  		throw(:halt, "Slow down there pilgrim")
    # end

	end
	
	
==== Partial / View based thresholding

	Partial / View based thresholding can take advantage of action based thresholds or named thresholds.
	
	# --- apps/views/whatever/index.html.erb
	<!--
		Cool html stuff
	-->
	<% unless threshold :stuff_to_protect, :limit => [1, 3.minutes] %>
		<!-- Show your stuff, access wasn't thresholded -->
		<div> Coolness?! </div>
	<% else %>
		<%= wait(:stuff_to_protect) %>
		<!-- your users gets a wait message -->
	<% end %>
	
==== Cross Controller/Action thresholding

	Using named thresholds it is possible to control a threshold across several controllers, actions, and partials.
	
	Just like in 'Partial / View based thresholding' theses three methods can be used to control the flow of what
	is rendered.
	
	Methods:
		* threshold						- Returns True|False, was the request OVER the threshold
		* permit_another? 		- Will the threshold permit another request
		* currently_exceeded? - Is the current request over the threshold
	
	Helpers (Override at your leisuer in Merb::GlobalHelpers)
		* wait(threshold_name) 		- displays the wait message
		* captcha(threshold_name) - displays the captcha
	

=== Threshold Names vs Threshold Keys

	* A threshold name is used as the identifier so the controller can keep track of registered options
	* A threshold key is how to look up a particular threshold's data in the user's session
	
	By default the threshold key where information is stored in the session is the "controller_name/action_name".
	This can of course be changed by specifying a name (as described in Partial based thresholding).  The key
	can also be set on a per parameter value basis as well.  All three examples are below
	
	The three attributes:
	default_threshold_name - only provided as a default in the event a name isn't given
	threshold_name 	- name of the threshold, if it is ever passed as nil merb_threshold will use default_threshold_name
	thershold_key 	- this will be the same as the threshold_name except when params based thresholds are being used
	
	class Home < Application
	
		# An action based threshold
		def action1
			threshold :limit => [2, 10.minutes]
			# default_threshold_name: "home/action1"
			# threshold_name:					"home/action1"
			# threshold_key:					"home/action1"
		end
		
		# A named threshold
		def action2
			threshold :tuff_threshold, :limit => [1, 1.day]
			# default_threshold_name: "home/action2"
			# threshold_name:					"tuff_threshold"
			# threshold_key: 					"tuff_threshold"
		end
		
		# A param key threshold
		# Given request to: /documents/499
		def action3
			threshold :document_viewer, :limit => [10, 30.minutes], :params => [:document_id]
			# default_threshold_name: "home/action3"
			# threshold_name:					"document_viewer"
			# threshold_key: 					"document_viewer/499" # value is based on value of params[:document_id]
		end
	end


=== Clearing / Destroying sessions
	
	Since all merb_threshold data is stored in the session clearing or destroying the session will remove
	any data stored for that session.  This becomes important if you clear session on logout, because it 
	essentially resets the access history for a user.  To get around this simply copy out the merb_threshold
	data before clearing/destroy and then put it back in the new 'anonymous' session afterwards.  This applies
	to logins if they clear/destroy the anonymous session before presenting the authenticated one.
	
	You could do something like this or whatev.
	def logout
		clear_keys = session.keys - [
    	'merb_threshold_history',
    	'merb_threshold_exceeded_thresholds',
    	'merb_threshold_waiting_period']

  	session.regenerate
  	clear_keys.each { |k| session.delete(k) }
	end


=== permit_another? vs currently_exceeded?

	*  permit_another?
		* Note: takes the threshold_name
		* determines if an immediate subsequent request would exceed the threshold
		* Suggested Use: when one request 'protects' another
			* Example: A GET request that retrieved a form could protect the subsequent POST request
		
	*  currently_exceeded?
		* Note: takes the currenty threshold_key
		* determines if the current request is in over the threshold
		* Suggested Use: when throttling the amount of requests a resource gets
			* Example: An API that allows X amount of free accesses before display a 'please pay me' page

==== A case for permit_another?

	* A sign up page has a limit of 5 signups per minute.
	* A user signs up 5 accounts in a row (w/ no captcha | wait)
	* On the sixth GET of the form the request's call to captcha() determines another request will exceeded the threshold, so a captcha is presented
	
==== A case for permit_another?

	* A user is promised access to a free API 5000 times per day
	* The user's app makes 5000 requests
	* On the 5001 request currently_exceeded? could be used to render an 'over the limit' partial


=== Misc. Notes

 * The objective behind naming thresholds is the ability to use them across controllers and actions
		This allows the ability to show a captcha on a sign up page, but register the access only when posted

 * default_threshold_name vs threshold_key: the key is the key used to find the threshold statistics
		in a users session.  It is not the same as the threshold_name when the :params options is used
		
		# routed to: /blog/index/35
		threshold :blog_index, :params => [:blog_id]
		default_threshold_name 	= "blog/index"
		threshold_name 					= :index  # ( referring to the local variable 'threshold_name')
		threshold_key						= "blog_index/35"
		
		# routed to: /user/create
		threshold
		default_threshold_name	= "user/create"
		threshold_name					= nil
		threshold_key						= "user/create"

 * Thresholds can be named whatever you want, so they can be programmatically created.  Also
	the option :params => [:blog_id,:etc] is available that will use param values as part of the key
		
 * merb_threshold currently stores everything in the session (may have support for)
		additional stores in the future.  On that note, it is not recommended to be used
		with cookie base sessions because it could be easy for a user to go over 4k worth
		of data if the site is composed of many controllers, actions, and partials

 * A threshold is EXCEEDED when it goes beyond its limit
 		Given:
			threshold :limit => [3,30.seconds]
		The threshold would be considered EXCEEDED on its 4th request.
		
 * the 'threshold' class method is just a wrapper for before filters
		See MerbController#threshold for examples
				
 * Time.now is used for all times since access times are relative
		The frequency class could be a lot more useful if it didn't explicitly use Time.now and you could
		look forward and backward over time.  Fortunately that complexity isn't needed for actions because
		you are accessing them 'now' and the plugin is concerned with 'when' they were last accessed.
		
 * If you dont like the way units are cast using :limit => [1,30.minutes]
		You can override Frequency#cast_units OR specify :limt => [1,30,:minutes]
