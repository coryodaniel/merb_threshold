merb_threshold
==============

Merb Threshold provides an easy way to apply control the number of times an view or partial
is accessed by a particular user.  Thresholds can be applied to multiple partials per page and can
even span controllers and actions.

==== Usage
DOCUMENTATION COMING SATURDAY HOLY CRAP!


==== Notes
 * The objective behind naming thresholds is the ability to use them across controllers and actions
		This allows the ability to show a captcha on a sign up page, but register the access only when posted

 * default_threshold_name vs threshold_key: the key is the key used to find the threshold statistics
		in a users session.  It is not the same as the threshold_name when the :params options is used
		
		# routed to: /blog/index/35
		threshold :blog_index, :params => [:blog_id]
		default_threshold_name 	= "blog/index"
		threshold_name 					= :index  # ( referring to the local variable 'threshold_name')
		threshold_key						= "blog_index/35"
		
		# routed to: /user/create
		threshold
		default_threshold_name	= "user/create"
		threshold_name					= nil
		threshold_key						= "user/create"

		
 * Thresholds can be named whatever you want, so they can be programmatically created.  Also
	the option :params => [:blog_id,:etc] is available that will use param values as part of the key
		
 * merb_threshold currently stores everything in the session (may have support for)
		additional stores in the future.  On that note, it is not recommended to be used
		with cookie base sessions because it could be easy for a user to go over 4k worth
		of data if the site is composed of many controllers, actions, and partials

 * Note that thresholds presents captcha, wait, halt when it is EXCEEDED.  So
 		Given:
			threshold :limit => [3,30.seconds]
		The captcha, wait, or halt would happen on the 4th occurrance.
		
 * the 'threshold' class method is just a wrapper for before filters
		See MerbController#threshold for examples
				
 * Time.now is used for all times since access times are relative
		The frequency class could be a lot more useful if it didn't explicitly use Time.now and you could
		look forward and backward over time.  Fortunately that complexity isn't needed for actions because
		you are accessing them 'now' and the plugin is concerned with 'when' they were last accessed.
		
 * If you dont like the way units are cast using :limit => [1,30.minutes]
		You can override Frequency#cast_units OR specify :limt => [1,30,:minutes]
